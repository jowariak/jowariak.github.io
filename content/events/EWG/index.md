#summary:
abstract: I gave a talk at the Environmental Working Group (EWG) on the role of geospatial AI in addressing PFAS contamination and broader environmental health challenges. The discussion focused on how data-driven, uncertainty-aware modeling can support more targeted monitoring, improve decision-making under limited testing resources, and help communities and policymakers better identify and respond to environmental risks.
