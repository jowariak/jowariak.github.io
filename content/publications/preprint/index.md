  Importance: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support clinicians in diagnostic
  decision-making holds significant potential; however, evidence regarding its clinical
  utility remains mixed. In many cases, the interaction between healthcare professionals
  and AI systems does not improve collaborative performance compared to the standalone
  performance of humans or AI. Currently, the underlying mechanisms that limit human-AI
  collaboration are poorly understood.

  Objective: To examine the impact of AI advice on diagnostic decision-making among experts
  and novices, focusing on understanding the role of explainability (XAI) on users’
  reliance on advice.

  Design, Setting, and Participants: A mixed-methods design combining a crossover
  experimental design with a think-aloud and an eye-tracking study arm was conducted in
  2023. Participants were task experts (radiologists) and novices (non-radiologist
  physicians and medical trainees) from 10 countries, with the think-aloud and eye-tracking
  conducted in Germany.

  Intervention: Participants reviewed 50 patient cases containing head CT scans and
  patient information. Every case was reviewed in three time-separate sessions in
  randomized order. In each session, participants were exposed to a different experimental
  condition: (a) control, i.e., no AI prediction presented; (b) basic advice, i.e., AI
  prediction without annotations; and (c) XAI advice, i.e., AI prediction with annotations.
  For each case, participants determined whether the patient had an intracranial
  hemorrhage (ICH), rated their confidence, and, if applicable, rated the usefulness of
  the AI advice.

  Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Diagnostic performance, confidence in the diagnosis, case
  reading time, and AI advice usefulness ratings.

  Results: The analysis included 125 participants. The mean age was 28.5 years (SD = 6.72),
  and 55.2% identified as female. Underreliance on correct AI advice was associated with
  high uncertainty and had a more detrimental impact on diagnostic performance than
  overreliance on incorrect advice. XAI advice reduced underreliance and improved
  performance and confidence, particularly for more difficult cases with ICH. AI advice,
  particularly XAI, did not reduce reading time. XAI was perceived as more useful than
  basic AI advice, especially among novices.

  Conclusions and Relevance: Underreliance on AI appears more harmful than overreliance,
  highlighting the need for counterstrategies that go beyond current XAI methods
